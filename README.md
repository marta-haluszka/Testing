# Me and my IT exercises
## About me
Hey:)
My name is Marta Haluszka.
This repository shows my first steps in the IT world.
I know quite a few tools and I have some tech skills which are necessary to be a good tester.
In my work I had already tested web applications and reported the bugs I found in Jira.
I am precise and focused on details, determined and I try to improve my knowledge every day. So far I have been working on these projects:
1. **First project**
- Manual testing of the web application - searching site containing suggestions, extensions, filter parameters, additional filters, and grouping.
- Unit tests - checking whether the programmers have correctly completed individual tickets.
- Functional tests - checking whether the application has the necessary functionalities.
- Exploratory tests - checking whether the application is user-friendly and whether it meets all the assumed business requirements.
- Acceptance tests - checking the operation of the entire application before handing it over to the client.
2. **Second project**:
- Creating and configuring virtual machines for automatic testing of client software on various operating systems (Darwin, Windows, Linux).
- Creation of configuration files (phyton board) for customer-supplied automated test scripts.
- Identify bugs for developers to repair, and retest the software.
- Contact with the Product Owner and Engineers' Lead (in English) regarding the performed tests: prioritizing and solving current problems.
- Contact with developers ( client side) regarding the performed tests (in English).
3. **Third project**:
- Testing automated systems connecting plugins and demo presentations for the client (in English).
- Taking care that the solution presented to the customer is user-friendly and intuitive.
4. **Fourth project**:
- Create user guides for client software and developer-created plugins.

### Program to creating a character in the RPG Warhammer
Also, I am learning Python and I am putting my first program into this repository. I will try to add as many possibilities to this program as I can, but these are my first steps in programming.
In the first phase of creating this code, the user will need polyhedral dice and a character card to create a character.
In the next phase, I plan to add a library to randomly generate dice rolls.
The next part will be combining the two previous phases so that the user can choose the best method for him to create a character :)
