# Me and my IT exercises
## About me
Hey:)
My name is Marta Haluszka.
This repository shows my first steps in the IT world.
I know quite a few tools and I have some tech skills which are nessesary to be good tester.
In my work I had alerdy test web application and report the bugs I found in Jira
I am precise and focused on details, determined and I try to improve my knowledge every day.
In this repository I put some example of my work.
Also, I am learning Python and I am putting my first program into this repository.
### Program to creating a character in the RPG Warhammer
I will try to add as many possibilities to this program as I can, but these are my first steps in programming.
In the first phase of creating this code, user will need polyhedral dice and a character card to create a character.
In the next phase, I plan to add a library to randomly generate dice rolls.
The next part will be combining the two previous phases so that the user can choose the best method for him to create a character :)
